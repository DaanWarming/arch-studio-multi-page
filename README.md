# Arch Studio multi page website

Arch Studio is a multi page website made after a design of a figma file from the frontendmentor.io website.
This project is made to practice my html and css skills and to showcase it on my portfolio.


Live Demo


# Things I learned: 

- Use more general styles in the beginning of the css file to reduce the repetition.

- Use background-image in css to import images when text is going to be displayed over it, It works more responsive than to import the image in html.
